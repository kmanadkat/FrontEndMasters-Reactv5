## About Course Project - Adopt Me

In this course I have learnt to build real-world applications using modern React! Much more than an intro, I had started from the ground up, getting all the way to using the latest features in **React, including hooks, effects, context, & portals**. Throughout the course, I have pieced together tools from the entire React ecosystem (like **Reach Router**) to build a full application to browse adoptable pets.


## Topics Covered

1. Pure React
2. npm, ESLint & Prettier
3. Parcel
4. JSX
5. Hooks
6. Effects
7. Dev Tools
8. Handling Async
9. Reach Router
10. Class Components
11. Error Boundaries
12. Context
13. Portals and Refs


## Project Installation

Just like any other React Js project **node** & **npm** are the prerequisites to move forward.

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/kmanadkat/FrontEndMasters-Reactv5`
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory of project
3. Run `npm run dev` & parcel will bundle the project into `dist` folder & host it on `http://localhost:1234`
